      <description>BackgroundFrom Monday to Friday I create dashboards in Power BI for a company in Manchester (and really enjoy it). During the start of lockdown I decided to challenge myself and scratch up on my R skills and attempt to create a covid-19 dashboard using the flexdashboard package in R. I considered using Shiny but the integration with Github Pages seemed a little easier, and meant that all I had to do for deployment was click one button in R and commit the updated html file directly to github - no hosting issues.</description>

      <description>What better way to guage the opinion of the general public than trawling through online comments on articles. The visuals below were created by scraping the comments from an article about the proposed capital gains tax in NZ and using R to do some basic text mining and data visualisation.
 This wordcloud above shows the overall sentiment of the comments, seperating each word into positive (green) or negative (red) groupings based on the users comments.</description>

      <description>Here’s an interactive map of ‘notable’ trees in the Auckland region I created this using Leaflet, a powerful mapping package in R. Take your time to scroll around the Auckland region and click on the green points to see what kind of special trees you have in your neighbourhood! (datasource)
 The inspiration for this post came from Isaac Bain’s tutorial where he used freely available data to map the DOC huts around NZ.</description>
