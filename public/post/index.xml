      <description>What better way to guage the opinion of the general public than trawling through online comments on articles. The visuals below were created by scraping the comments from an article about the proposed capital gains tax in NZ and using R to do some basic text mining and data visualisation.
This wordcloud above shows the overall sentiment of the comments, seperating each word into positive (green) or negative (red) groupings based on the users comments.</description>

      <description>Here’s an interactive map of ‘notable’ trees in the Auckland region I created this using Leaflet, a powerful mapping package in R. Take your time to scroll around the Auckland region and click on the green points to see what kind of special trees you have in your neighbourhood! (datasource)
The inspiration for this post came from Isaac Bain’s tutorial where he used freely available data to map the DOC huts around NZ.</description>
