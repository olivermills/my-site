      <description>BackgroundFrom Monday to Friday I create dashboards in Power BI for a company in Manchester (and really enjoy it). During the start of lockdown I decided to challenge myself and scratch up on my R skills and attempt to create a covid-19 dashboard using the flexdashboard package in R. I considered using Shiny but the integration with Github Pages seemed a little easier, and meant that all I had to do for deployment was click one button in R and commit the updated html file directly to github - no hosting issues.</description>
