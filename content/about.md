I decided to create this website to learn the fundamentals of web design and Git as well as showcasing my personal data projects in R. I'm a 25 year old kiwi living in Manchester, UK with a fascination for telling stories through data and information. In my spare time I enjoy shooting [film photos](/2019/02/16/film-photos/) and creating [electronic music](https://soundcloud.com/gusnwes), preferably with a cold craft brew somewhere along the way.
